# Contour : Pairwise Marine Distances

Jorge Assis (2016)
A high-resolution polygon is converted to an infinite resistance surface. 
Minimum distances between sites are computed with a shortest path algorithm considering the infinite resistance of land and null resistance throughout the sea. 
The outcomes are a matrix of pairwise distances, a figure to visualize if sites are well represented in the study area and a figure depicting an example of a shortest marine distance.
The main file with the sites should be structured as “Name Lon Lat” or “Name Lat Lon”. Coordinates must be be decimal degrees.
